### cs106b-huffman-code
- Motivation: while taking data structures and algorithms course, the idea of compression using variable length code (VLC) based on a trie seemed appealing, and piqued interest for applications in various data compressions, one of which is Huffman coding. 

#### Code: /Huffman/src/encoding.cpp
- implementation of huffman coding process, with guidelines by CS106B-Stanford
- created with Qt Creator with StanfordCPPLib
